3 types
    Horizontal

        common in mature industries

            Economies of scale

        Aquire suppplier - backward integration
    Conglomerate
        random unrelated companies
        decreases risk and diversify

    Right reasons to do a deal
        Synergies
            Earn more money than you otherwise would
        To get big fast
        To fill out a product line
        To expand geographically
        To increase market share and market power
    Not so great reasons
        To diversify
        For tax reasons
        To expand debt capacity
        Management self interest
        Capitalize on underutilized assets
        Look for companies with faster growth, better technology and better margins

Types of Synergies
